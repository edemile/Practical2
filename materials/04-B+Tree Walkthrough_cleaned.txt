Large Scale Information Storage and Retrieval B+ Tree Walkthrough Mark Fontenot, PhD Northeastern University Insert: 42, 21, 63, 89.

B+ Tree : m = 4. ● Initially, the first node is a leaf node AND root node. ● 21, 42, … represent keys of some set of K:V pairs ● Leaf nodes store keys and data, although data not shown ● Inserting another key will cause the node to split. 2.

Insert: 35.

B+ Tree : m = 4. ● Leaf node needs to split to accommodate 35.

New leaf node allocated to the right of existing node ● 5/ 2. values stay in original node; remaining values moved to new node ● Smallest value from new leaf node (42) is copied up to the parent, which needs to be created in this case.

It will be an internal node. 3.

B+ Tree : m = 4.

Insert: 10, 27, 96. ● The insert process starts at the root node.

The keys of the root node are searched to find out which child node we need to descend to. ○ EX: 10.

Since 10. < 42, we follow the pointer to the left of 42. ● Note - none of these new values cause a node to split 4.

B+ Tree : m = 4.

Insert: 30. ● Starting at root, we descend to the left-most child (we’ll call curr). ○ curr is a leaf node.

Thus, we insert 30. into curr. ○ BUT curr is full.

So we have to split. ○ Create a new node to the right of curr, temporarily called newNode. ○ Insert newNode into the doubly linked list of leaf nodes. 5.

B+ Tree : m = 4.

Insert: 30. cont’d. ● re-distribute the keys ● copy the smallest key ( 27. in this case) from newNode to parent; rearrange keys and pointers in parent node. ● Parent of newNode is also root.

So, nothing else to do. 6.

B+ Tree : m = 4.

Fast forward to this state of the tree… ● Observation: The root node is full. ○ The next insertion that splits a leaf will cause the root to split, and thus the tree will get 1. level deeper. 7.

Insert 37.

Step 1.

B+ Tree : m = 4. 8.

Insert 37.

Step 2.

B+ Tree : m = 4. ● When splitting an internal node, we move the middle element to the parent (instead of copying it). ● In this particular tree, that means we have to create a new internal node which is also now the root. 9
